# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-on-Breast-Cancer-and-CIFAR-10-Datasets
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction in data analysis and machine learning. It helps identify patterns and reduce the datasetâ€™s complexity while retaining important information. In this report, I explore the application of PCA on two datasets: Breast Cancer and CIFAR-10.
